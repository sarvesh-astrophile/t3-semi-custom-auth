Okay, I've analyzed the files you provided. To create a tutorial for beginners on building a web application with backend and frontend components, you can break down the functionalities into the following modules:

1.  **User Authentication & Session Management:**

    - **User Signup:** Creating new user accounts (`lib/server/user.ts`, `lib/server/password.ts`). This involves:
      ~~- Input validation for username and email (`lib/server/user.ts`, `lib/server/email.ts`).~~
      ~~- Hashing user passwords securely (`lib/server/password.ts`).~~
      ~~- Storing user data (`lib/server/db.ts`, `lib/server/user.ts`).~~
      ~~- Generating an initial recovery code (`lib/server/user.ts`, `lib/server/utils.ts`).~~
    - **User Login:** Authenticating existing users (`lib/server/user.ts`, `lib/server/password.ts`, `lib/server/session.ts`). This includes:
      - Verifying credentials against stored hashes.
      - Creating and managing user sessions (`lib/server/session.ts`).
      - Handling session tokens and cookies.
    - **Logout:** Invalidating user sessions (`lib/server/session.ts`).
      ~~- **Session Persistence & Validation:** Ensuring users remain logged in across requests and validating session tokens (`lib/server/session.ts`).~~

2.  **Email Verification:**

    - Generating and sending verification codes/links to users (`lib/server/email-verification.ts`, `lib/server/utils.ts`).
    - Verifying the code provided by the user.
    - Updating user status to "email verified" (`lib/server/user.ts`, `lib/server/email-verification.ts`).
    - Managing email verification requests and cookies (`lib/server/email-verification.ts`).

3.  **Password Management:**

    - **Password Strength Checking:** Ensuring users choose strong passwords (`lib/server/password.ts`).
    - **Forgot Password & Reset:**
      - Initiating the password reset process (`lib/server/password-reset.ts`).
      - Sending password reset codes/links via email.
      - Verifying the reset code.
      - Allowing users to set a new password (`lib/server/user.ts`, `lib/server/password.ts`).
      - Managing password reset sessions and cookies (`lib/server/password-reset.ts`).

4.  **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** (`lib/server/2fa.ts`)

    - **General 2FA Setup Flow:** Guiding users to set up at least one 2FA method.
    - **Recovery Codes:**
      - Generating and displaying recovery codes for users to store securely (`lib/server/user.ts`, `lib/server/utils.ts`).
      - Allowing users to use a recovery code to regain access if they lose their 2FA device (`lib/server/2fa.ts`).
      - Resetting 2FA methods using a recovery code.
    - **Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP):** (`lib/server/totp.ts`)
      - Setting up TOTP with an authenticator app (generating a secret key, displaying a QR code).
      - Verifying TOTP codes during login or sensitive actions.
      - Storing encrypted TOTP keys (`lib/server/encryption.ts`).
    - **WebAuthn (Passkeys & Security Keys):** (`lib/server/webauthn.ts`)
      - **Passkey Registration:** Allowing users to register device-bound passkeys.
      - **Security Key Registration:** Allowing users to register hardware security keys.
      - **Authentication with Passkeys/Security Keys:** Verifying users with their registered passkeys or security keys.
      - Managing WebAuthn challenges and credentials.
    - **2FA Redirection Logic:** Directing users to the appropriate 2FA challenge page after login if 2FA is enabled (`lib/server/2fa.ts`).

5.  **Core Backend Services & Security:**
    - **Database Interaction:** Abstracting database queries and operations (`lib/server/db.ts`). (This is foundational rather than a user-facing module but crucial for beginners to understand).
    - **Encryption & Decryption:** Securely handling sensitive data like recovery codes and TOTP keys (`lib/server/encryption.ts`).
    - **Rate Limiting:** Protecting against brute-force attacks and abuse for various actions (login attempts, sending emails, TOTP verification) (`lib/server/rate-limit.ts`, `lib/server/request.ts`).
    - **Utility Functions:** Common helper functions like generating random OTPs and codes (`lib/server/utils.ts`).

When creating the tutorial, you can structure it by first building the basic user authentication, then adding email verification, password reset, and finally layering on the different 2FA methods. The core services like database interaction, encryption, and rate limiting would be introduced as needed within each functional module. This approach will help beginners build a secure and functional application step-by-step.
